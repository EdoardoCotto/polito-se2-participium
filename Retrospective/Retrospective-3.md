RETROSPECTIVE 3 (Team 3)
=====================================

The retrospective should include _at least_ the following
sections:

- [process measures](#process-measures)
- [quality measures](#quality-measures)
- [general assessment](#assessment)

## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed 3 vs done 3
- Total points committed 23 vs done 23
- Nr of hours planned 99h vs spent 103h 

**Remember**  a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing 455
- Code review completed 3
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed 22

> Please refine your DoD 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _#0_   |   18    |    -   |     57     |      57,5    |
|   24   |    9    |    5   |    12,5    |      14      |
|   25   |    9    |    5   |    11,5    |      13      |
|   26   |   10    |    13  |    18      |      18,5    |
   

> place technical tasks corresponding to story `#0` and leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task (average, standard deviation)

|            | Mean | StDev |
|------------|------|-------|
| Estimation | 2,15 | 1,799 | 
| Actual     | 2,24 | 1,805 |

- Total task estimation error ratio: sum of total hours estimation / sum of total hours spent -1 = 0,0404

  $$\frac{\sum_i spent_{task_i}}{\sum_i estimation_{task_i}} - 1$$

  
## QUALITY MEASURES 

- Unit Testing:
  - Total hours estimated 4,5
  - Total hours spent 5,5
  - Nr of automated unit test cases  455
  - Coverage (if available) 98,3%
- Integration testing:
  - Total hours estimated
  - Total hours spent
- E2E testing:
  - Total hours estimated 7
  - Total hours spent 6,5
- Code review: 
  - Total hours estimated 3
  - Total hours spent 3
- Technical Debt management:
  - Strategy adopted: we decide to obtain at least grade B across all analysis sections and focus on items with high impact.
  - Total hours estimated at sprint planning 27,5h
  - Total hours spent 28h
  


## ASSESSMENT

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

> Propose one or two

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
