### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _Uncategorized_  |    9   |      |    30h       |  33h           |
|   6  |    7   |    5    |    11h 30m      |   12h 30m      |  
|   7   |   9      |   8     |   15h 30m           |   15h 20m    |
|   8   |   10      |   5    |    14h 30m       |   12h 30m      |
|   9   |    8    |      3 |     12h         |     11h 45m      |
|   10  |    8     |     5   |     14h 30m       |   11h 45m       |

> story `Uncategorized` is for technical tasks, leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

|            | Mean | StDev |
|------------|------|-------|
| Estimation |  1.95  |  1.66 | 
| Actual     | 1.98 |  1.76 |

- Total estimation error ratio: sum of total hours spent / sum of total hours effort - 1 =  -0.0119

    $$\frac{\sum_i spent_{task_i}}{\sum_i estimation_{task_i}} - 1$$
    
- Absolute relative task estimation error: sum( abs( spent-task-i / estimation-task-i - 1))/n = 0.0036

    $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n \left| \frac{spent_{task_i}}{estimation_task_i}-1 \right| $$

## ASSESSMENT

- What did go wrong in the sprint?

      - We wanted to improve our schedule time to don't work too much in the last day, but we don't reach this goal for the different commitment we have and because of the interconnaction of the task that link the work of all of us.

      - We had more problem with the organitation of the scrum meeting for our different calendary, so we didn't have enough comparisons between us.

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

      We have done a good estimation but we have to discuss more about the story because sometimes we lost some details that could change the estimation of some task.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?

      A positive lessons is that together we can solve the problem very fast, when we find a bug also if we have to change front end and back end together to solve it.

      The negative one is that we have learned that it is difficult to organize work so that the others don't have to wait for someone else to finish theirs
       
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

      We were able to do a better job of dividing tasks than in the previous sprint, but it is still far from our ideal and is simply better than before.

- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

      We couldn't manage the time well as we want, because the tasks were highly interdependent, making it difficult to start a task before the previous one was finished. As a result, we lost time even when we were available to work on this project.

         

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)

      -Better task time estimation: By talking more about those tasks to understand possible features that we don't see immediately.

      -Better time management: By organize meeting to find the needs of backend and frontend to don't have problem with API's results, so we can start working on the same time knowing what the others are doing and don't leaving task that is necessary for others component of the group unresolved for too much time.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
  
      - Things we are proud of as a team is that we consistently work to deliver high-quality results for each sprint and we are always ready to help each other whenever needed.
