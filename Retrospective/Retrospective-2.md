RETROSPECTIVE 2 (Team 3)
=====================================
## PROCESS MEASURES 

### Macro statistics

- Number of stories committed 5 vs. done 5
- Total points committed  vs. done 
- Nr of hours planned  vs. spent  (as a team)

**Remember**a story is done ONLY if it fits the Definition of Done:
 
- Unit Tests passing
- Code review completed
- Code present on VCS
- End-to-End tests performed

> Please refine your DoD if required (you cannot remove items!) 

### Detailed statistics

| Story  | # Tasks | Points | Hours est. | Hours actual |
|--------|---------|--------|------------|--------------|
| _Uncategorized_  |       |      |           |             |
|     |       |        |          |         |  
|      |         |        |              |       |
|      |         |       |           |         |
|      |        |       |              |           |
|      |         |        |            |          |

> story `Uncategorized` is for technical tasks, leave out story points (not applicable in this case)

- Hours per task average, standard deviation (estimate and actual)

|            | Mean | StDev |
|------------|------|-------|
| Estimation |   |  | 
| Actual     |  |  |

- Total estimation error ratio: sum of total hours spent / sum of total hours effort - 1 = 

    $$\frac{\sum_i spent_{task_i}}{\sum_i estimation_{task_i}} - 1$$
    
- Absolute relative task estimation error: sum( abs( spent-task-i / estimation-task-i - 1))/n = 

    $$\frac{1}{n}\sum_i^n \left| \frac{spent_{task_i}}{estimation_task_i}-1 \right| $$

## ASSESSMENT

- What did go wrong in the sprint?
    
      -We were supposed to do things early and not leave them for the last day, like in the previous sprint. But it got worse than the previous sprint. We didn't do a third of the work in the first 9 days because the tasks are interconnected. We all have to do the tasks according to the correct schedule to do well. Unfortunately, most people didn't do their work on time, so we ended up with this problem.And it was the same problem until the last day, and most of the work was completed in the last 2 days.

      -Another problem is that when some people wanted to do their own task, they didn't read the group first to see what message the previous person had left that was related to their task. They did the work without paying attention to the group and then checked the group.

      -Another problem was that some people didn't have a role in some stories, and everyone had to have a role in every story.

- What caused your errors in estimation (if any)?

      The estimate had a problem because it was not done realistically and was just done like the previous sprint. It needs to be reviewed and done more carefully and each task needs to be discussed. Most people, when they estimate their work, think it is much lower than expected and it is not realistic.

- What lessons did you learn (both positive and negative) in this sprint?
        
      People should do their jobs more responsibly so that other people can do their jobs and not harm others. Most of the work should be done throughout the week and not just on the last 2-3 days of the week.
       
- Which improvement goals set in the previous retrospective were you able to achieve? 

      We were able to do a better job of dividing tasks than in the previous sprint, but it is still far from our ideal and is simply better than before.

     
  
- Which ones you were not able to achieve? Why?

      We couldn't manage the time and it got even worse than the previous sprint. Because people couldn't be responsible and do their own work according to the time and only started doing the work in the last 2-3 days.

         

- Improvement goals for the next sprint and how to achieve them (technical tasks, team coordination, etc.)



      -Better task time estimation: By talking more about those tasks and being realistic about how long they will take.

      -Better time management: By completing your task on a specific day and not leaving it until the last day.

- One thing you are proud of as a Team!!
